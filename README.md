## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reader-app.git
   cd reader-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   ```

4. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### AI Configuration

To enable AI features such as article summarization, you need to configure Claude API:

1. Run the setup tool:
   ```bash
   npm run update-claude-key
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter your Claude API key

See the detailed [AI Configuration Guide](docs/ai-configuration.md) for more information about obtaining and setting up your API key, troubleshooting, and supported features.

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- **users**: User profiles and preferences
- **articles**: Saved articles with metadata and content
- **highlights**: User highlights within articles
- **notes**: User notes associated with articles or highlights
- **tags**: User-defined tags for organization
- **collections**: User-created collections of articles

## Future Performance Optimizations
